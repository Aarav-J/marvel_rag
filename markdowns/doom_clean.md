*—**Emperor Doom**[[source]](/wiki/One_World_Under_Doom_Vol_1_1 "One World Under Doom Vol 1 1")*Equal parts super-genius and megalomaniac, **Victor von Doom** better answers to the self-proclaimed moniker of **Doctor Doom**, the despotic ruler of the Eastern European nation of Latveria. Victor was born in a Romani camp, the son of a witch named Cynthia "Cynthia von Doom (Earth-616)"), who died after making a deal with the demon Mephisto "Mephisto (Earth-616)"). Swearing revenge, Victor spent his life honing his skills in both science and magic. In his academic youth, Doom was the college rival of Reed Richards "Reed Richards (Earth-616)"), future leader of the Fantastic Four "Fantastic Four (Earth-616)") as Mister Fantastic. When left scarred by a machine meant to make contact with his late mother, a disgraced Doom roamed the world until he was taken in by a tribe of Tibetan monks, who helped him forge a suit of armor topped off by an iron mask to hide his face. Rechristened Doctor Doom, Victor returned to his homeland, using his lifetime of skills to seize power as its new ruler.

Although Doom wishes to bring order and betterment to humanity, he intends to enforce this goal by his own hand and with an iron fist. Ruthless and prideful, Doctor Doom has come into conflict with the super hero community at large, but the Fantastic Four remain his biggest enemies due to Victor's shared history with and personal vendetta against Mister Fantastic, whom he blames for the accident that cost him his face. Victor is not without allies, like his adoptive son Kristoff Vernard "Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)"), or his personal champion, Victorious "Zora Vukovic (Earth-616)"). Doom has had several brushes with great power, stealing it from beings such as the Silver Surfer "Norrin Radd (Earth-616)"), the Beyonder "Beyonder (Earth-616)") and the Scarlet Witch "Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)"). In his greatest triumph, he took the nigh-omnipotence of the Beyonders and reshaped the remains of the destroyed Multiverse into Battleworld "Battleworld (Latverion)"), holding supreme power as God Emperor until his ultimate downfall and the restoration of all there was by the hand of Mister Fantastic.

In recent times, Doctor Doom proved a key player in stopping a worldwide vampire invasion and helped an incapacitated Doctor Strange "Stephen Strange (Earth-616)") dispel the Darkforce enveloping the Earth in temporary exchange for the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme. However, Doom refused to give up the mantle following Earth's liberation, seeing that he had much more work to do before he believed the world to be safe in his own eyes. Declaring himself **Emperor Doom**, he forcibly unified the planet as "United Latveria," promising global peace and prosperity while mysteriously controlling the world's leaders.

History
-------

*This is an abridged version of Victor von Doom's history. For a complete history see **Victor von Doom's Expanded History/Expanded_History "Victor von Doom (Earth-616)/Expanded History")***

### Early Years

**Victor von Doom** was born in a Romani camp outside Hassenstadt, Latveria. His mother, Cynthia "Cynthia von Doom (Earth-616)"), was killed in a bargain with Mephisto "Mephisto (Earth-616)") that went wrong. Despite his father's attempts to care for her, a noblewoman died and Werner von Doom "Werner von Doom (Earth-616)") fled with a young Victor on a cold winter's night. Victor survived the cold, but unfortunately his father did not. Doom sought to increase his knowledge of both science and magic in order to rescue his mother, whose death he blamed on Mephisto. In his youth, Victor fell in love with a woman named Valeria_(Earth-616) "Valeria (Latverian) (Earth-616)"), but she resisted his advances.

### Becoming Doctor Doom

The State University "State University (Hegeman)") in Hegeman, New York "New York (State)") offered Victor a scholarship. While attending classes there, he met Reed Richards "Reed Richards (Earth-616)") and Ben Grimm "Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)") for the first time. They developed a dislike for each other, leading to Reed Richards commiting the first prank he had ever pulled, changing Victor's last name on a trophy to "Doof."

 

*_and_Victor_von_Doom_(Earth-616)_from_Fantastic_Four_vs._the_X-Men_Vol_1_4_002.jpg) Ignoring Richards' warning*

Richards and Doom were intellectual peers. The two debated esoteric theories day and night that amazed faculty members, who compared their brilliance to that of Albert Einstein "Albert Einstein (Earth-616)") and Leonardo da Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)"). While Richards designed his starship, Doom became obsessed with developing a machine that could project the astral form of a being into other dimensions, seeing it as a way to free his mother's soul from Mephisto's clutches. Reed pointed out a flaw in Doom's calculations, but Doom arrogantly ignored his warnings, feeling Reed was trying to upstage him, likely due to their dislike for each other. The machine exploded, scarring Doom's face. He was soon expelled for conducting unethical experiments. From then on, he blamed Reed Richards for the destruction of his face as well as his expulsion.

 

**

Disgraced and bitter, Doom traveled the world. Eventually he came upon a small Tibetan village of monks who assisted him in creating a suit of armor. He returned to his homeland of Latveria to overthrow the leader and declare himself king. He then began to use his country's resources in order to further his plans of world domination. These schemes led Doom into conflict with the Fantastic Four "Fantastic Four (Earth-616)") on many occasions, as well as many other super heroes.

 

*_from_Captain_America_Reborn_Vol_1_4_001.jpg) Doctor Doom's primary armor*

### The Fantastic Four

Doom first confronted the Fantastic Four by holding Sue Storm "Susan Storm (Earth-616)") hostage. Doom forced the other members of the team to travel back in time using his time platform to retrieve the mystical Stones of Merlin. Later, he duped Namor "Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)") into teaming up with him to destroy the team. His next scheme was swapping minds with Mister Fantastic, but was discovered, returned to his body, and shrunk to sub-atomic size. He ended up in the world of Sub-Atomica, where he quickly took control using his scientific knowledge and began plaguing the Fantastic Four with shrink rays. He was again defeated by the Fantastic Four with the aid of Ant-Man "Henry Pym (Earth-616)"). His next attempt at defeating the Fantastic Four involved using the Terrible Trio "Terrible Trio (Earth-616)"), a group of thugs who had been given powers by Doom. This venture ended with him being transported into outer space by a solar wave. He was later found floating in space by Rama-Tut_(Earth-6311) "Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)"), who revealed to Doom that he was one of his ancestors. Believing that they might in fact be the same person, they decided that Rama-Tut would return to the future after sending Doom back to Earth. Back on Earth, Doom again clashed with the Fantastic Four. This time, they defeated him by hypnotizing him into believing he had destroyed the group.

The hypnotic spell was eventually broken by a Latverian stage magician who had come to Doom's castle "Castle Doom (Doomstadt)") to entertain him. Doom, realizing he had been tricked, was furious and traveled to America to take his revenge on the Fantastic Four, who incidentally had lost their powers. Despite the Four having no powers, Doom was again defeated, this time with the aid of Daredevil "Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)"). His next attack came when he manipulated an army of the world's super villains to attack the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm.

When Doom battled and defeated the Silver Surfer "Norrin Radd (Earth-616)"), he stole the Surfer's powers and surfboard, becoming one of the most powerful beings on Earth. With these new-found powers, he was able to finally defeat the Fantastic Four. He then began running amok causing havoc all over the world. After another confrontation with the Fantastic Four, Doom was tricked into flying into the barrier Galactus "Galan (Earth-616)") set up around the Earth, and the Surfer's powers and surfboard returned to their rightful owner.

### Camelot

Doctor Doom and Iron Man "Anthony Stark (Earth-616)") traveled to Camelot where Stark thwarted Doctor Doom's attempt to solicit the aide of Morgan le Fay and Doctor Doom swore deadly vengeance for that interference, which had to be indefinitely delayed in the interest of returning to the present day.

### An Heir to the Throne

After reclaiming the Latverian throne from a mad Prince Zorba with the help of the Fantastic Four, Doom took a young Latverian boy named Kristoff Vernard "Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)") who was orphaned by Zorba's forces under his wing and made him his heir.

### Battleworld (Beyonder)

 

*_from_Marvel_Super_Heroes_Secret_Wars_Vol_1_11_0001.jpg) Doom removes his mask after obtaining the Beyonder "Beyonder (Earth-616)")'s powers*

Another coup came on Battleworld "Battleworld (Beyonder)") during the first of the so-called Secret Wars "Secret Wars (1984 Event)"), an event during which the powerful and mysterious Beyonder "Beyonder (Earth-616)") kidnapped several heroes and villains from the Earth to have them fight with the promise of giving the winners their heart's desire. Doom became the leader of the villains, and after their defeat, escaped his holding cell and constructed a device out of the body of Klaw "Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)"), to drain the power of Galactus. Using his stolen power he was able to attack his true target, the Beyonder. Doom lost the battle, but as the Beyonder came closer to dissect and study Doom, he managed to activate a device in his chest plate which hovered barely within his reach. Doom drained the Beyonder and became even more powerful. Too powerful, in fact--Doom was unable to rest, lest he destroy the universe with a dream. The Beyonder had however survived. He took possession of Klaw's body and used Klaw's guile to trick Doom into losing control of his stolen power, reclaiming it and defeating him. The Beyonder then vanished, with Doom and Klaw.

### Emperor Doom

As part of a plan to conquer the world, Doom kidnapped Zebediah Killgrave "Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)"), the mind-controlling super villain known as Purple Man, and imprisoned him within a gigantic Psycho-Prism which not only bestowed Purple Man's powers on Doom, but also augmented them to a global scale.

 

*_and_Victor_von_Doom_(Earth-616)_from_Marvel_Graphic_Novel_Emperor_Doom_-_Starring_the_Mighty_Avengers_Vol_1_1_002.jpg) Doom demonstrates his willpower by resisting the Purple Man "Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)")'s mind control*

Using this device, Doom manipulated the United Nations "United Nations (Earth-616)") and every government to legally name him emperor of the Earth. Under Doom's command, the planet saw prosperity, equality, and the end of war and hunger, but at the cost of every citizen's free will. Additionally, Doom began to feel that his victory was almost meaningless, due to any lack of challenge to achieve or maintain his goal.

One challenger to Doom's rule surfaced in the form of the Avenger "Avengers (Earth-616)") Wonder Man "Simon Williams (Earth-616)"), whose unusual physiology rendered him unaffected by Doom's mind-control. After freeing several of his fellow teammates from Doom's control, Wonder Man attacked Doom Island, the location of the Psycho-Prism. Doom's dissatisfaction caused him to give up on a chance to prevent the heroes from destroying the Psycho-Prism. Thus, the citizens of the Earth broke free from Doom's control, and the Earth soon returned to its status quo.

### Freeing his Mother

Doom eventually freed his mother's soul with the assistance of Doctor Strange "Stephen Strange (Earth-616)"). Strange had won the Aged Genghis "Aged Genghis (Earth-616)")' contest and was obligated to answer the request of the runner-up. The scheme to free his mother required Doom to incur her undying hatred; by volunteering Strange to take her place, Cynthia von Doom was so disgusted at her son that she became too pure to remain in Hell and departed for Heaven "Heaven (Paradise)"). Strange wondered if Doom had been aware of this outcome when he made the deal, but Doom simply mused that his mother's hatred was a price he was willing to pay to ensure her freedom.

### Counter-Earth

When Franklin Richards "Franklin Richards (Earth-616)") was kidnapped by Onslaught "Onslaught (Earth-616)"), Doom (who saw this as an opportunity to steal the being's powers) joined the Fantastic Four, the Avengers "Avengers (Earth-616)") and the X-Men "X-Men (Earth-616)") to battle Onslaught in Central Park. An enraged Hulk "Bruce Banner (Earth-616)") was able to crack open Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught remained as pure psionic energy, and separated Hulk and Banner, planning to spread across the planet. Thor "Thor Odinson (Earth-616)") plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, the majority of Avengers, the Hulk-less Banner, and even Doom (who was grabbed by Iron Man "Anthony Stark (Earth-616)")) followed. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroyed Onslaught.

Doom, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers and Banner were believed dead, but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth "Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)") to keep them safe. After several months away, the missing heroes returned from Counter-Earth in a massive ship breaching the dimensional barriers. Doom attempted to take over the ship in mid-flight, leading to a battle with Thor which left both men adrift in dimensional space for a time.

Doom's travels took him back to Counter-Earth. He took over the world and moved it from the pocket universe to his original universe with magic and technology, putting it in the same orbit as Earth, only on the opposite side, creating a Counter Earth. Eventually he was overthrown and returned to his rightful planet.

### Valeria

 

*_and_Doctor_Doom%27s_Mystical_Armor_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_3_67_0001.jpg) Demonic Armor*

Due to a series of complex events involving the resurrection of Galactus, Susan Richards experienced became pregnant with a child she had previously miscarried. Once again, she experienced problems with her pregnancy. With Reed away, Johnny Storm "Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)") contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom would be unable to refuse a chance to succeed where Reed failed. Doom used a problem Johnny had with his powers, an inability to 'flame off' without technological support, caused by being overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone, to save Sue's daughter. Doom channelled Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only apparent condition for his aid was that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria "Valeria Richards (Earth-616)")' after his long-lost love.

Valeria's birth inspired a new plan where Doom made Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake as part of a deal with a trio of demons known as the Hazareth Three "Hazareth Three (Earth-616)"). By sacrificing his old lover, Doom was granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. This began by making Valeria's skin becoming his new armor. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin Richards in Hell, immobilized Doctor Strange, and neutralized the FF's powers. He tortured Sue, Johnny, and Ben and taunted Reed by leaving him in his magical library. Doom compared this to giving a dog a road-map and concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to achieve sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, which allowed Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free the rest of the team and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell.

### Hell & Back

Determined to ensure that Doom wouldn't be a further threat, Reed took control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment. Simultaneously Reed subtly drove his family away so he could trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension where Doom would never threaten anyone again. However, this plan backfired when the rest of the Four attempted to rescue Reed, which resulted in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively. Reed was forced to kill Ben his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, and Reed was later able to use the same machine Doom once tried to create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life.

 

* The return from Hell itself*

When Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, fell to Earth, it passed through time and space, momentarily breaching the gateway to Hell and providing Doom with an escape route. Upon his return to Earth, Doom regained control of Latveria, used its military to locate Mjolnir, and attempted to seize its power for himself, believing the hammer had chosen him to be its wielder by freeing him from Hell, but he soon discovered that he was not worthy.

### Civil War

During the super hero Civil War "Civil War (Event)"), Reed Richards and several other heroes defeated a Doombot in New York City. Doom himself may or may not have been responsible. In another ploy to gain leverage during this time of disunity, Doom proposed an alliance between Latveria and the Black Panther "T'Challa (Earth-616)")'s country of Wakanda. Black Panther and his new wife, Storm "Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)"), however, saw through Doom's intrigue.

### Atlantean Refugees

So Doom sought to align his country with another. Following the destruction of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, Doctor Doom made Latveria into a refugee camp for the Atlanteans "Atlanteans (Homo mermanus)") and struck an alliance with Loki "Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)") in his plot to manipulate Thor to unwittingly release his Asgardian enemies.

### Doctor Doom Arrested!

Iron Man led S.H.I.E.L.D. "Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)") forces and the Mighty Avengers_(Earth-616) "Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)") to Latveria when it was discovered that one of Doctor Doom's satellites carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City. Using time travel, Doctor Doom had been involved in a romantic relationship with Morgan Le Fay "Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)") at the time in exchange for her tutelage in the mystic arts. This arrangement was interrupted when the Mighty Avengers arrested Doctor Doom and incarcerated him for crimes against humanity. During the battle, Doctor Doom, Iron Man, and the Sentry "Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)") stumbled through an open time travel portal, trapping Doctor Doom and his opponents in the past. Doctor Doom and Iron Man managed to return all three to the present.

### Fantastic Force

Doctor Doom was released from prison by the Fantastic Force "Fantastic Force (Earth-807128)"), a group from a distant future returned to the present. The Fantastic Force kidnapped Doom and the Human Torch to use them as a power source for a time travel device that was made from the dead body of Galactus "Galan (Earth-807128)"). The whole plan of the Fantastic Force was led by the future Sue Storm "Susan Storm (Earth-807128)"). In the end, Reed Richards and Sue Storm not only found a home for the future refugees, but also freed Doctor Doom and the Human Torch. In what should have been a happy ending, Doctor Doom killed the future Sue Storm, to "restore his honor."

### The Cabal_(Earth-616) "Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)")

In the aftermath of the Skrull Invasion "Secret Invasion (Event)"), Doctor Doom became a member of the Dark Cabal_(Earth-616) "Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)") alongside Norman Osborn "Norman Osborn (Earth-616)"), Emma Frost "Emma Frost (Earth-616)"), Namor, Loki, and the Hood "Parker Robbins (Earth-616)"). Due to Doom's status, Dracula "Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)") approached him to secure a non-aggression pact - between both Doom and the Cabal - before attacking Britain. Doom, who loathed Dracula, refused to acknowledge his regal standing.

 

* Doctor Doom in the Dark Cabal*

Morgan le Fay traveled to present day Latveria to punish Doctor Doom for failing to come through on his end of their bargain. The Dark Avengers "Dark Avengers (Earth-616)") went to Doctor Doom's aid after Morgan le Fay defeated him in mystical combat. Norman Osborn rescued Doom from mystical paralysis, and they linked their armours to access Doom's time cube in order to go back in time and stop Morgan le Fay. Doom either could not or would not destroy le Fay, despite having the power to do so, because her future was intertwined with his. Instead, Doom sent her back in time, forcing her to battle her way back to her present, and thereby distracting her from fighting Doom and the Dark Avengers. Doom showed contempt for Osborn and his "ignorance" to the time stream and went back to the present and undid all that le Fay had done to the Dark Avengers. Then Doom magically restored Latveria and rebuilt his castle with use of the time cube.

### Marquis of Death

 

*_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_3_566_001.jpg) The Masters of Doom*

After his initial capture and release for crimes against humanity, Doom revealed that he had been taught everything by a master, someone that was far more powerful and evil than he himself, and that he would soon be returning. When his master, the Marquis of Death "Clyde Wyncham, Jr. (Earth-807128)"), arrived, he was displeased with what Doom had been doing in the two decades since his departure. He expected Doom to be the vicious ruler of the Earth, not the ruler of a small country constantly defeated by heroes such as the Fantastic Four.

After playing with his mind, he beat Doom and banished him to the Pliocene Age to die. With his new apprentice, the Marquis of Death began to torment the Fantastic Four as punishment, but was defeated by them. When Richards chose not to finish off his defeated foe, the Marquis' Apprentice, revealed to be Doom, did it for him. Dr. Doom waited for years in the past using all his knowledge and sorcery to survive. He then became the Marquis' Apprentice once more and waited for the moment that the Marquis would be weakened enough for him to gain his revenge, and it came when he faced Mr. Fantastic. Doom declared that all rivalries between him and Richards had long been settled to his satisfaction.

### Asgardians in Latveria

When the Asgardians moved from Asgard "Asgard (City)"), which was floating above Broxton, Oklahoma "Oklahoma (State)"), to Latveria on Loki's suggestion, Doom secretly began capturing Asgardians, experimenting on them to discover what gave them their immortality. He even mutilated some Asgardians by converting them into cyborgs, serving his twisted ambitions. He set these cyborgs loose upon Balder "Balder Odinson (Earth-616)") and company. However, Thor came to avenge his people and engaged Doom in combat. After realizing that he could lose, Doom fled and entered the weapon he had been working on: a new version of the Destroyer Armor "Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)"). He reengaged Thor and began to beat him down, with Thor unable to hurt him. Realizing that Doom's armor was powered by a battery, Thor held off Doom until the suit's power finally ran low, forcing Doom to retreat.

Doom had one last meeting with Norman and his Cabal, but still refused to side with Norman. To show off his power, Norman unleashed his 'secret weapon' on Doom and defeated him. But Doom was obviously prepared for this sort of attack, as he had sent a Doombot in his place. The Doombot unleashed advanced technology to attack the Cabal and Norman's Dark Avengers. Doom had made it clear that no one could control him.

### The Doomwar

When Doom learned of a xenophobic group of Wakandans known as the Desturi "Desturi (Earth-616)"), he began his plans for gaining access to the vast amounts of vibranium located in Wakanda. Vibranium has the ability to be magically charged and has infinite power potential, something Doom had figured how to use to make himself virtually unstoppable. Doom developed nanite cameras which were dispersed into all Wakandans, making them unknowing spies for Doom. With all the security information of Wakanda available to him, he was able to gain access to the vault that contained the country's vibranium. In a last ditch effort to stop him, T'Challa rendered all Wakandan vibranium inert and useless.

### Intelligencia

Long ago, Doom betrayed the Leader "Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)") and his super villain group the Intelligencia "Intelligencia (Earth-616)"). The group later reformed and planned to 'lobotomize' their competition and capture eight of Earth's greatest minds, including Doom. Doom was captured by the Intelligencia using the Hulk Robot "Cosmic Hulk (Earth-616)").

### Children's Crusade

 

* With the Life Force*

When the Young Avengers "Young Avengers (Earth-616)") helped Magneto "Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)") find his daughter Wanda "Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)"), they found her with no memory of her past and betrothed to Doctor Doom. He was revealed to have played a part in increasing the power levels of the Scarlet Witch through the Life Force, leading to the events which disassembled the Avengers and the alteration of reality known as M-Day.

When the Young Avengers traveled back in time with Wanda, they were able to restore her memory, and thus her powers. Back in the present, Doom stole the Life Force from Wanda in an effort to become fully omnipotent. He offered to make perfect the lives of all those present and even revive the dead, only if he became the king of the world. The Young Avengers, the Avengers and the X-Men refused, instead battling him until his new powers overloaded, leaving him powerless again. He escaped, teleporting himself away after taking responsibility for all of Wanda's actions, stating that she was only a puppet, and only he was powerful enough to create that kind of chaos.

### To the Future Foundation "Future Foundation (Earth-616)")

After the death of the Human Torch, Doom joined the Future Foundation "Future Foundation (Earth-616)") with the condition that Reed Richards would restore the intelligence he lost at the hands of the Intelligencia. He helped the team search for the Richards' of alternate universes and was kidnapped by "Reed-Alpha "Reed Richards (Earth-12498)")", who brought him to Latveria and confronted Kristoff von Doom "Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)"), who had taken over as ruler. There, with the help of the Future Foundation, they rebuilt Reed-616's "Bridge "Bridge (Alternate Reality Viewer)")", a device that allowed Reed to peer into alternate realities and travel to them at will. While on the Bridge, "Reed-Alpha" freed Doom to help battle the Mad Celestials "Celestials"). Rather than taking his chance to escape, Doom stayed and fought for Latveria. Ultimately, Doom lost the battle and seemingly died.

### Return

With no knowledge as to how he survived the blast from the Mad Celestials, Doom woke up in the middle of the ruins of the Interdimensional Council of Reeds "Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)"), where Valeria had left him a present: the full army of lobotomized Doctor Dooms from alternate realities who were previously captured by the Council, along with two Infinity Gauntlets from other universes. With these resources, Doom created the Parliament of Doom "Parliament of Doom (Multiverse)"). He later returned to again rule Latveria, and was targeted by Lucia von Bardas "Lucia von Bardas (Earth-616)") and the Red Ghost "Ivan Kragoff (Earth-616)"), who wanted to get revenge on Doom for past indiscretions.

Doom journeyed to the universe that one of his Infinity Gauntlets had belonged to, which was now empty and desolate, and used the gauntlet to breathe life into it anew. He separated magic and science, creating the basic rules for their existence, created new lifeforms and made himself their ruler. On a world where science and magic were wed, his creations turned on him and six rulers divided Doom's Infinity Gems between them. Reed and Nathaniel Richards "Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)") entered this universe to save Doom after being told by Valeria that he was in grave danger. They managed to convince five of the rulers to pardon Doom and managed to escape the clutches of the sixth, bringing Doom back to their universe. Upon their return, Doom declared that he and Richards were even again.

### Incursion in Latveria

After his return, Latveria became the site of an incursion, a collision between Earth and one of its alternate universe counterparts. This incursion was different, however, in that it was controlled by a mysterious group known as the Mapmakers "Mapmakers (Multiverse)"), who had rigged the other Earth to explode and wished to mark Doom's Earth for potential expansion. Doom fought off the Mapmakers' servants, the Sidera Maris "Sidera Maris (Multiverse)"), with the help of his adopted son Kristoff Vernard, whilst unbeknownst to him, the Illuminati "Illuminati (Earth-616)") blew up the other Earth. After the incursion ended, Doom was alerted to a rock that had fallen from the sky, which was in truth the Mapmakers' beacon. Doom contacted Reed Richards and Stephen Strange in order to confront them about the Illuminati's presence in Latveria and the incursion, but to his fury, they refused to give him answers and Reed warned him not to contact him in regard to the incursions again.

### AXIS

After imprisoning Loki due to the manipulations of an older Loki_(Earth-14412) "Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-14412)"), Doom discovered that his people were fighting one another and rallying against him. After beginning to have bad thoughts himself, Doom realized that Latveria was under a telepathic attack. He used a spell to protect himself, and discovered that the Red Skull_(Earth-616) "Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)") had been responsible for this attack. Meanwhile in Castle Doom, Loki had been freed by Valeria, who used his truth sword Gram to release a "truth wave" which stopped the telepathic influence over Latveria. Soon after, Magneto arrived in Castle Doom to recruit Doom into a team of villains to stop the Red Skull, who had now become the "Red Onslaught".

Doom journeyed to Genosha with the rest of the villains that were recruited by Magneto. They destroyed one of the Skull's Stark Sentinels, which was keeping some of the heroes who had defied the Skull captive. Doom and the Scarlet Witch began to cast an inversion spell to alter the moral compass of the Skull in order to defeat him. The spell was successful, but it accidentally also affected everyone else on the island. After the island was covered by the spell, all of the villains disappeared without a trace, including Doom. Doom returned to Latveria, changed into a selfless and kind man due to the spell, ready to make amends for his past sins. Knowing that the (now-inverted) Scarlet Witch would come to Latveria for revenge on Doom due to his past manipulations, Doom created a device capable of channeling a portion of the Witch's powers. With the help of an Avengers team_(Earth-616) "Avengers (Doctor Doom) (Earth-616)") assembled by Valeria, Doom managed to get hold of a portion of the Scarlet Witch's powers, which he used to make right one of his past misdeeds, the murder of Cassie Lang "Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)"), and bring her back to life.

Wanda managed to finally confront Doom, who was saved by Magneto and Quicksilver "Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)"). While Magneto and Pietro tried to convince Wanda not to cross the line and take Doom's life, Doom fled to another dimension, where he made a pact with a demigod to bring Doctor Voodoo "Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)") back to life. Voodoo's brother Daniel "Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)") possessed Scarlet Witch in order to make her cooperate and help Doom cast a re-inversion spell. After teleporting to New York, where the inverted heroes and villains were fighting, the inverted Red Skull helped Doom and Daniel cast the spell, which successfully brought almost everyone back to normal, including Doom.

Victor took advantage of the confusion brought by the re-inversion and abducted the Red Skull to Latveria, for experimentation.

### Time Runs Out

Over the following months, Victor worked with a team of scientists to reverse-engineer the Mapmaker "Mapmakers (Multiverse)") artifact he had gathered from the incursion that took place in Latveria. The Mad Thinker_(Earth-616) "Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)") successfully managed to map their entire network. Doom planned to use the Molecule Man "Owen Reece (Earth-616)"), whose energy frequency matched with the beacon's, to oppose whatever was the origin of the incursions and the decay of the Multiverse. The Molecule Man took Doom elsewhere, a blank void from where they subsequently traveled backwards through the mists of time and the various planes of reality.

 

*_from_New_Avengers_Vol_3_31_002.jpg)*

Doom and the Molecule Man travelled to the past to an alternate reality to witness the origin of said reality's Molecule Man. The journey restored the Molecule Man's mind and he told Doom of his origins. The Molecule Man was a singularity across every single universe, a "bomb" created by the Beyonders to detonate across the entire Multiverse at once. If a Molecule Man died, his universe died with him, so if every Molecule Man died at the same time, the entire Multiverse would die simultaneously. The Molecule Man killed his counterpart early and convinced Doom that in order to diminish the charge to save the Multiverse, he had to prematurely kill every single Molecule Men before they could fully go off in 25 years. However, the Molecule Men's deaths caused tiny contractions in the Multiverse, as per the Beyonders' design, which began the incursions.

Eight years after the beginning of his journey, when Doom had killed thousands of Molecule Men, he encountered one who would be the first of his Black Swans "Black Swans (Multiverse)"), a cult he would form around the religious concept of himself, under the identity of "Rabum Alal" (the "Great Destroyer"). A group of Black Swans, including Yabbat Ummon Tarru "Yabbat Ummon Tarru (Earth-1365)"), rebelled against Doom's original path and sought a new one. They destroyed other Earths during incursions as an offering to Rabum Alal and to buy more time for other universes (for every Earth destroyed during an incursion, two universes and one of the Earths were saved).

Even if Doom's actions resulted in the destruction of realities, Doom attempted to save as much as he could from the destruction, believing that setting off the Molecule Men earlier would diminish the charge of the explosion the Beyonders had planned. However, he later realized the futility of his actions, as the Beyonders had built the Molecule Men "too well" and killing them was still causing the Multiverse to die, so Doom changed course and began capturing Molecule Men in order to create his own bomb to destroy the Beyonders.

 

*_from_New_Avengers_Vol_3_33_001.jpg) Confronting the Beyonders*

In the present, Doctor Strange and the Black Priests "Black Priests (Multiverse)") attacked the Library of Worlds to hunt Rabum Alal, who had been believed to be one of the main causes of the decay of the Multiverse. Doctor Doom presented himself as Rabum Alal to Strange and clarified that the real destroyers of the Multiverse were the Beyonders. In a last ditch attempt to save the Multiverse, Doom took Strange and the countless captured Molecule Men to confront the Beyonders. By weaponizing the Molecule Men, Doom was able to take out the Beyonders at the cost of thousands of universes, leaving only a dozen, and the power wielded by those Beyonders were then channeled into the last Molecule Man, thus stealing their omnipotence for Doom.

### Secret Wars "Secret Wars (2015 Event)")

> We weren't going to prevent the early death of the Multiverse. The Beyonders had built me too well...so we got tricky. And that's when Stephen "Stephen Strange (Earth-616)") joined us--right before the end. While the Swans "Black Swans (Multiverse)") were busy killing mes...you and I were busy building something else. A better bomb. A better me. We couldn't stop the Beyonders from destroying everything, but we could draw them out...destroy them...steal their power...and store it someplace safe. Where it could be used to preserve some of what had been lost "Battleworld (Latverion)").

*—Molecule Man "Owen Reece (Earth-616)")[[source]](/wiki/Secret_Wars_Vol_1_5 "Secret Wars Vol 1 5")*When the Multiverse finally perished in the final incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610, Doom used the power of the Beyonders to salvage the remains of several realities and built a patchwork planet: Battleworld "Battleworld (Latverion)"). He ruled as God Emperor Doom with the help of Sheriff Stephen Strange, his right hand, and the Foundation "Foundation (Earth-15513)"), his left hand. The Molecule Man, who was the container for the power of the Beyonders, continued empowering God Emperor Doom and remained hidden in a chamber. During the early days of Battleworld, Doom encountered an alternate version of the Fantastic Four "Fantastic Four (Earth-15513)"), one in which Reed Richards did not exist. Their Sue Storm "Susan Storm (Earth-15513)") fell in love with Victor, and they had two children, Franklin "Franklin von Doom (Earth-15513)") and Valeria "Valeria von Doom (Earth-15513)").

 

*_from_Secret_Wars_Vol_1_4_cover.jpg) God Emperor Doom*

As eight years went by, Doom and Strange twisted the memories of the inhabitants to the point they would no longer remember what had existed before Battleworld. Even though he was an omnipotent ruler, Victor ultimately felt he was failing his duty as a god; he thought he was not capable of properly inspiring his people, and even though Battleworld was the perfect world he wanted, he considered himself its only flaw.

The relative monotony of Doom's reign was interrupted with the discovery of an empty vessel in the domain known as Utopolis, a life raft that had been built by the survivors of Earth-1610, the villainous Maker "Reed Richards (Earth-1610)") and the Cabal_(Earth-616) "Cabal (Namor) (Earth-616)"). The vessel had allowed them to survive the final incursion and kept them in suspended animation for the eight years that had passed.

Sheriff Strange recognized the design of the raft, which was that of a similar vessel he had found three years earlier and had kept hidden in his Isle of Agamotto. When Strange investigated the vessel of his proprietary, he freed its occupants, the survivors of Earth-616, among which were Mr. Fantastic, Namor and Black Panther.

After being informed of the nature of Battleworld and its ruler, the survivors of Earth-616 helped Sheriff Strange confront the Maker and the Cabal, who had been finally pinned down by Battleworld's police force, the Thor Corps "Thor Corps (Earth-15513)"). Doom remained unwilling to take part in the conflict, until he saw Mr. Fantastic in the scene, which is when he immediately teleported to Utopolis, and stopped the fray, demanding the newcomers to recognize his authority. When the Phoenix "Scott Summers (Earth-616)") refused to submit to him and attacked Doom with his flames, Doom shrugged off the attack and executed Summers by breaking his neck with one hand. To prevent Doom from prejudicially acting upon the interlopers, Stephen used his magic to teleport them away. Following the disappearance of the Cabal and the heroes from Earth-616, Doom confronted Strange for disobeying him, and ultimately killed him after Stephen accused him of being afraid of Richards.

Doom later commanded Valeria and the department of science of Battleworld, the Foundation, to find the interlopers, pinning Strange's murder on them. Three weeks later, Battleworld was in disarray, with disorder having escalated into open rebellion in several domains, with somebody called "the Prophet" forming an army against Doom. The Prophet, who was later revealed to be none other than the Cabal's Maximus the Mad "Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)"), and his army marched forward to Castle Doom. Some of Doom's allies started fighting against him, namely the Thor Corps, who had been convinced to fight against their god by the Thor "Jane Foster (Earth-616)") survivor of Earth-616.

 

* Versus Mister Fantastic*

When he decided to step into the fight, Doom was confronted by Black Panther and Namor, with the former having acquired an Infinity Gauntlet from Sheriff Strange's sanctuary. After a battle that took them through the different planes of reality, Doom bested Black Panther, but he soon realized the fight was a distraction. He teleported to the Molecule Man's chamber, which had been found by Mister Fantastic. The Molecule Man partially stripped Doom from his power in order to allow a fair fight. During the furious confrontation, Doom accused Richards of believing he could have done better had he had the power of the Beyonders, and when Reed conceded he did, so did Doom. On the grounds that both agreed, the Molecule Man gave the power of the Beyonders to Reed, destroying Battleworld in the process.

 

*_and_Reed_Richards_(Earth-616)_from_Marvel_2-In-One_Annual_Vol_1_1_001.jpg) Reed Richards healing Doom's face*

With the power of the Beyonders he had received from the Molecule Man, and with help from his revived family, Mister Fantastic began to restore the Multiverse as the Eighth Cosmos, including Earth-616. After accepting that Doom was going to eternally resent him, Reed decided to alter Victor's memories so he believed he was dead, on the hopes that Victor could become a better man if he no longer pursued ultimate power and believed his biggest rival was gone. In addition to altering Victor's memories, Reed cured him of his scars before returning him to Latveria.

### Infamous Iron Man

The feeling of unfulfillment left in Victor during his tenure as a deity prompted him to look for other ways to find personal realization. While rethinking his life, Doom was ultimately struck with the notion that if the selfish act of ultimate power wasn't his calling, maybe the opposite could hold true. Thus he set out to become a force of good in the world. This new perspective also led Doom to abdicate his throne and leave his kingdom behind. Before departing Latveria, Victor appointed the top military mind in the country, General Karadick "General Karadick (Earth-616)"), as temporary head of state so he could help Latveria transition into a free state.

 

*_from_Invincible_Iron_Man_Vol_3_1_001.jpg) Reformed Doom*

In order to make more apparent his transition to the side of the angels, the now-unarmored Victor decided to become an ally to Tony Stark "Anthony Stark (Earth-616)"), a man he had always secretly admired and deemed as an equal. Iron Man first encountered this new version of Victor when he was following the the trail of Madame Masque "Whitney Frost (Earth-616)"). Doom revealed his intentions to turn over a new leaf, and eventually helped Stark exorcise the demon-possessed Masque. Doom remained on high alert, in case new demonic incursions appeared.

During the second Civil War, Doom tried to help Stark regain his composure following the tragic loss of his best friend Jim Rhodes "James Rhodes (Earth-616)") and the destruction of the Stark Tower. When this conflict ended with Stark falling into a coma, Doom saw Stark's fall as a message that directed the form his penance would need to take, and he decided to pick up the mantle of Iron Man. Mephisto objected to Doom's attempt at redemption, and tried to torment him using a simulacrum_(Earth-616) "Cynthia von Doom (Mephisto's Simulacrum) (Earth-616)") of his dead mother. At the same time, S.H.I.E.L.D. attempted to capture Doom for his past crimes. In the middle of this gauntlet, Victor found solace in a reluctant ally, Tony Stark's ex-girlfriend Amara Perera "Amara Perera (Earth-616)"), whom Victor impregnated. In the end, Mephisto was banished, and Doom started slowly gaining S.H.I.E.L.D.'s trust.

 

* Doom as Iron Man*

### The Return of Doom

Doom's sudden turn against the super villain community sparked grievances that resulted in a group of villains led by The Hood "Parker Robbins (Earth-616)") joining forces to take down Victor. After the villains besieged Doom several times, the final battle occurred when The Hood attempted to take over Stark Industries, which happened not long after Stark had secretly recovered from his injuries. Tony confronted The Hood and stumbled into Victor. Doom took on The Hood and the demon possessing him one-on-one, and his face was severely burned by the demon in the process. Following the villains' defeat, Victor retreated to the ruins of Castle Doom.

During Victor's seclusion, the country fell under a tyrant regime. Doom was inspired by the leader of the resistance, Zora Vukovic "Zora Vukovic (Earth-616)"), to pull himself together and take control back of Latveria. Afterward, Victor imbued Zora with the Power Cosmic, turning her into her right hand the champion of Latveria named Victorious. In an attempt to capture Galactus and turn him into a source of power for Latveria and the world, Doom lured the cosmic entity to his country. With the help of the Fantastic Four, Victor succeeded in entrapping Galactus in Mount Doom. However, he arrested the team for trespassing into Latveria. The Fantastic Four managed to escape before Doom could execute them on live broadcast. In the process, the Invisible Woman publicly shamed Victor by turning his armor invisible, exposing his scarred face to the whole world.

### Framed and Conquest of Symkaria

As the conflict between Latveria and Symkaria became more heated, Doom had send one of his Doombots to join the discussion at the United Nation Assembly. However, the Hitman "Burt Kenyon (Earth-616)") then shot a bullet-like device at the Doombot which allowed Countess Karkov "Katarina Karkov (Earth-616)") to get access to all of Doom's Doombots and hack them, making them attack New York, supposedly on the behalf of Doom. Doom eventually took back control of the Doombots; however the damage had already been done, which prompted Doom to dismantle them.

As the situation kept on escalating, Doom begun seeing vision of himself as the great ruler of the world and with a happy family. When terrorists disguised as Latverians blew up the Antlion Space Station — and thereby creating a black hole — they framed Latveria and Doctor Doom for its destruction and many lost lives, in order to have Dimitri Fortunov "Dimitri Fortunov (Earth-616)") replace Doom. In an effort to not heat up the conflict, Doom willingly surrendered and was arrested. While being escorted to New York, the jet transporting Doom was attacked. Luckily, Kang freed Doom which allowed him to save himself from the falling jet. As Doom had become wanted, Morgan le Fay contacted him and offered him shelter. After telling her about his visions, she had Doom meet the Witness_(Earth-616) "Witness (Prophet) (Earth-616)") who could tell the future. However, Doom was then shot in the head by Taskmaster "Anthony Masters (Earth-616)"), killing him. He was then sent in Hell where he was confronted by Mephisto and his lover, Valeria_(Earth-616) "Valeria (Latverian) (Earth-616)"). After defeating the demon he was returned to life by Death "Death (Earth-616)") in le Fay's apartment where he blasted the hero Blue Marvel "Adam Brashear (Earth-616)") unconscious. After that, he went to the A.I.M. headquarters, where he battled Taskmaster and M.O.D.O.K._(Earth-616) "George Tarleton (Clone) (Earth-616)")

After visiting Fruzsina Markovich "Fruzsina Markovich (Earth-616)"), the woman he had married in his visions, he and Kang proceeded to return to Latveria. While on the road Doom was able to get his hands on the Ultimate Nullifier, prompting Kang to betray Doom, but Doom was able to retaliate, and moved on, leaving Kang behind. After returning to Latveria, he reunited with his loyalists and questioned each them about their loyalty. All were sincere, except for Vasily Makeyev who was revealed to be the traitor. After giving the Nullifier to Zora, he went at night to Dimitri Fortunov and forced him to stab his face before killing him.

Following his vision of his sons having scarred their own faces to emulate their father, Doom broke down leaving Victorious to comfort him and returned the Nullifier to him. Doctor Doom proceeded to take back his post as ruler of Latveria. Despite still seeing him as a mass murderer, the world's leaders asked him for help dealing with the black hole. Doom agreed on the condition that he would be allowed to take over Symkaria without interference. The Latverian forces invaded the neighboring state in little time and Doom killed Karkov in a sword fight. After successfully conquering Symkaria, Doom confronted Ionela Novotny, a Symkarian spy posing as a member of Doom's Children and mother of Victorious. He ordered his herald to kill her mother to which she complied. However, after all of this Doom was still haunted by his past as a villain and vowed to change himself for the better, and become the kind hearted ruler of Earth.

He constructed a laser able to reduce the activity of the black hole and cease the black hole itself. Despite every calculation showing a positive outcome, Victor became obsessed by Reed's good luck wish. He thought he mocked his project and that could be lead to a disaster, so he rearranged the settings of the laser. These modifications proved to be wrong and instead accelerated the black hole's activity, which seemingly destroyed the Earth.

Through this accident, Doom traveled beyond the black hole and discovered that his visions weren't about his future, but they were of another universe, where Victor abandoned his obsessions and became a peaceful man. The black hole was actually a wormhole and because the Antlion acted as a membrane that lead to a quantum entanglement between the two realities, their minds were interwoven and they could see one another's world. The Victor of this world showed the impressive progresses made in this universe, which comprised a galactic alliance with aliens superpowers such as the Kree, Badoon, Skrull and Shi'ar; and the collection of every artifact such as the Mandarin's ten rings, the Ultimate Nullifier, the Winter Casket, and the Watoomb's Scepter. Doom was almost convinced of the superiority of his alternate self. However, when he remarked his continuing obsession about Reed Richards as ludicrous and deemed his armor ridiculous, Doom killed his counterpart and destroyed the universe with the Ultimate Nullifier. This action apparently closed the wormhole and brought Doom back to his native universe. It also fulfilled Death's prophecy about Doom as her greater servant.

### The Last Annihilation

In preparation for a looming conflict called the Reckoning War, Doom set out to steal power from the Faltine lord Dormammu "Dormammu (Earth-616)"). Before leaving the planet to enact his plan, Victor arranged a political marriage with Victorious to give Latveria a queen. Doom invited the Fantastic Four and offered to forgive all past transgressions, but the ceremony went awry when Zora admitted at the altar that she had had a fling with the Human Torch even though it had happened before the engagement. In the end, the wedding ceremony did not go on, and Doom claimed to the television anchor that the broadcasted royal wedding was merely a pretense and ruse devised by Victorious to root out enemies invited to the ceremony. The unmarried Doom declares he may someday find a suitable bride but he had yet to do so, and dismisses Victorious. In retaliation, Doom bombarded Johnny with an extra dose of cosmic rays, making him unable to turn off his flame.

Doom left to space and an ally of his named Sister Talionis "Talionis (Earth-616)") manipulated a Skrullian cult to enact a ritual that made Ego the Living Planet "Egros (Earth-616)") become possessed by Dormammu, launching the dark lord's own campaign of conquest. Doom intercepted the Guardians of the Galaxy "Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)") and attempted to force them into his service, but he was subdued and instead formally joined the team. In the process of stopping the new threat, Doom and the Guardians carried out a ritual to free Chitauri Prime from Dormammu's possession, which allowed Victor to siphon a portion of the Faltine's power and imbue his armor with it. Following Dormammu's defeat, Doom left the Guardians.

### Reckoning War

When the Brotherhood of the Badoon "Brotherhood of Badoon (Earth-616)") launched an invasion of Earth, Latveria was one of their targets. As Doom and Victorious were defending the country, Doom recognized the Badoon's weaponry as beyond their technology and realized the Badoon's invasion was a distraction for something bigger. So, he left and put Victorious in charge of defending Latveria. Doom then broke into Camp Hammond, which was being used to store dangerous artifacts and retrieved the Tactigon. He next went to the Florida "Florida (State)") Everglades and waited for the Cormorant "Cormorant (Earth-616)") to appear, knowing that he would be coming after the Tactigon. After holding off Cormorant, Doom located Cormorant's master Helmsman "Helmsman (Earth-616)") through his telepathic link with his Cormorant and used magic to transport him to the Everglades. Doom then killed Helmsman to grant Cormorant his freedom so he could aid him in stopping the Reckoning War.

Using the Nexus of All Realities in Man-Thing's Swamp to travel to the Watchers' planet of Planet T-37x, Doom and Cormorant confronted the Reckoning's leaders as they approached the Apex of All Reality. The fight was short-lived, however. Wrath "Wrath (Earth-616)") used a code word to cause the collar around Cormorant's neck to rob him of his ability to fight while Doom's Tactigon was destroyed by Rapture's War-Blades.

### All-New Sorcerer Supreme

All of a sudden, the entire world became covered in Darkforce, completely blocking out the sun and paving way for the vampires to launch their worldwide invasion. Whereas most countries fell to the vampires, Doom was prepared for such a situation, having cast a spell that killed every vampire that crossed Latveria's borders. Taking advantage of this event, Doom sought to portray himself in a good light and gain additional power. He recruited the students of Strange Academy "Strange Academy (Earth-616)") and brought from Madripoor and back to Latveria, where he was approached by Strange's astral form and his wife Clea who wished for his assistance. Doom revealed to them that the instigator of all of this was actually the progenitor of all vampires, Varnae "Varnae (Earth-616)"), who at last had taken possession of Blade "Eric Brooks (Earth-616)")'s body. He then requested Strange to be given the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme in order to be granted enough power to undo Varnae's machinations, and although wary of this Strange agreed, but on the condition for him to return the title once the world was saved. As the new Sorcerer Supreme, Doom combined his powers with those of the students, and after Varnae was defeated, he managed to clear the sky, but also causing the vampires to lose their weakness to the sun. With that over, Doom twisted his promise to he give Strange the mantle back after he saved the world from every threat. He banished Strange back to his body, and announced to the entire world that he was now the new Sorcerer Supreme and their savior.

Immediately after the world returned to normal, Doom retreated and hid within Latveria which had been surrounded by a magical barrier that made him untraceable. Doom, in his astral form, summoned the Avengers in the Registan Desert where he demanded to know why they didn't use their powers to make the world a better place. He then showed them all a vision of an utopian world that could've been possible thanks to them, but the heroes responded that if they used force to change people it would most likely lead a worse scenario, as their job was to protect the world while humanity had to save itself. Having inherited the covenant between Strange and Cyttorak "Cyttorak (Earth-616)") which required the Sorcerer Supreme to battle the Scions of Cyttorak "Scions of Cyttorak (Earth-616)"), Doom refused to carry out this task himself and instead decided to leave it to someone else. He decided to give the task to Spider-Man and equipped him with an arcane armor and the Reeds of Raggadorr that would resurrect him eight more times if he died in his confrontation with the Scions. Some magical beings attempted to forge a sword to kill Doom in the Astral Plane, and although Doom killed them, they hid the magic sword in medieval Europe. Annoyed by this, he influced the Black Knight "Dane Whitman (Earth-616)") to trick his nemesis Reed and Sue Richards into finding the sword for him, allowing him to destroy it. Doom then attempted to kill them, but Reed, having learned some magic, teleported himself and Sue back home to Earth, where Doom was ready to announce his new world order.

Within a single day, every single world leader mysteriously and allegedly willingly swore fealty to Emperor Doom. All of the world's nations became United Latveria, though he allowed the governments to remain, so long as they answered to him. He promised to the world two things: the first was to end all war and the second was to provide both elite health care and education for all people. By killing Baron Zemo "Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)") and replacing him with a Doombot, he turned the infamous terrorist organization Hydra "Hydra (Earth-616)") into a force of good. As the heroes, including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, were skeptical about all of Doom's changes, they revealed Doom's trick to Hydra but inadvertently caused Hydra to revert back to their villainous ways, which Doom used to gain public support. Emperor Doom also claimed his dinosaur counterpart "Victor von Doom (Earth-TRN1101)") as his steed.

### Powers

Due to a deal made with Doctor Strange "Stephen Strange (Earth-616)"), Victor Von Doom is the current Sorcerer Supreme of Earth. As Sorcerer Supreme, Doom possesses vast knowledge and mastery of the mystic arts, as well as elevated magical capabilities, far surpassing what he could do previously. With this newfound increase in power, Doom was able to not only undo the Atlantean ritual casted by the ancient vampire Varnae "Varnae (Earth-616)") that had unleashed the Darkforce upon the whole world, but also grant every vampire immunity to sunlight. He could go toe to toe with beings like Dormammu "Dormammu (Earth-616)") and Cyttorak "Cyttorak (Earth-616)"), travel through the Astral Plane and various other planes of existence, and create magical barriers that not even the Scarlet Witch "Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)") could immediately get rid of. With the power of the Sorcerer Supreme, Doom amassed enough power to be recognized as a threat by Eternity "Eternity (Earth-616)") itself, with the cosmic entity even going as far as to attempt to kill Doom, only failing to do so due to the interference of it's Avatar; the Omega level Mutant Ororo Munroe "Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)"). This newfound level of magical power, combined with his vast intelligence and technology, allowed Doom to establish his own new world order in a matter of days.

 

*_from_Mighty_Avengers_Vol_1_11_001.jpg) Dr. Doom using his mystic powers*

* **Magic:** Doctor Doom was introduced to the mystic arts by his mother "Cynthia von Doom (Earth-616)") (who was of Romani and Latverian blood). He further developed his abilities by traveling through time and learning lost Dark Arts from individuals such as Morgan Le Fey "Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)"). After Dr. Strange stepped down as the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, Doom was amongst the candidates considered suitable to replace him. However the majority of his powers came from the Haazareth Three "Haazareth Three (Earth-616)"), and upon angering them most of his sorcery was removed and he was trapped in Hell as punishment. While they enhanced his powers he could achieve the following:
	+ **Mystical Blasts:** Doom's mystical expertise was only the minor magics of the Earth.
	+ **Mystical Force-Fields**
	+ **Spell Casting**
	+ **Spell Reversing**
	+ **Summoning:** Doom could summon hordes of demonic creatures.
	+ **Teleportation**
	+ **Dimensional Travel:** Doom could travel to other dimensions, including accessing the dreamtime.
	+ **Mystical Ensnaring**
	+ **Mystical Portals**
	+ **Healing:** Doom is able to heal himself and others from injuries.
	+ **Banishment**
	+ **Time-travel**
	+ **Power Absorption**
	+ **Elemental Manipulation:** Doom could create a blizzard within seconds.
	+ **Telekinesis:** After being sent to the dawn of time by Marquis of Death, Victor claimed that he spent a millennium transforming his body and mind, mastering long lost dark arts. This resulted in him to being able to use notable telekinesis as well as levitate himself.
	+ **Power Nullification:** Doom has repeatedly blocked the Fantastic Four's powers via sorcery.

Even without the support of the Haazareth Three "Haazareth Three (Earth-616)"), Doom has an extensive knowledge and mastery of the mystic arts and lost forms of magic, and has shown himself capable of not only performing a multitude of spells and rituals purely of his own innate mystical skills, but to do so on a level rivaling some of the best practitioners of magic on Earth.

* **Psionics:** Throughout his history, Doom has mastered some minor psychic abilities. Those skills originate from his encounter with aliens and mutants, naming the Ovoids and the Marquis of Death. Doom once claimed that he had evolved as a being, though it is not clarified how or to what extent and in later issues this seems to have been ignored by writers. The following powers however are usually considered to be a part of Doom's skillset. Finally, those skills are the result of personal mental development and are not to be confused with magic.
	+ **Mind Transference:** By training with an alien race, Doom has gained the ability to switch his mind with that of another nearby human being with whom he has made eye contact, a process which he learned from the alien Ovoids. Doom once changed his body with Human Torch. However, Doom prefers his own body and only uses this transference power as a last resort.
	+ **Hypnotism:** Doom is able to hypnotize individuals, as he did with a kraken on Counter Earth.
	+ **Technopathy:** Doom can exert technopathic control over certain machines, most notably the Doombots, but can control other technologies too, as he did with his suit's charger, describing his ability as latent telepathy.

Former Powers 

*_and_Galan_(Earth-616)_from_Fantastic_Four_World%27s_Greatest_Comics_Magazine_Vol_1_10_001.jpg) Doctor Doom after stealing Galactus' Power Cosmic, rendering the latter mortal*

* **Power Cosmic:** After stealing the Power Cosmic from the Silver Surfer "Norrin Radd (Earth-616)"), Doom became enormously powerful. He easily defeated the Fantastic Four "Fantastic Four (Earth-616)"), plunged one part of the world in darkness, froze an entire tropical region, and accelerated the evolution of apes into terrifying creatures. Doom lost these powers when he was tricked into flying into the barrier Galactus "Galan (Earth-616)") set up to prevent Silver Surfer from leaving Earth. In a separate instance, Doctor Doom stole the Power Cosmic from Galactus himself. He stole all of Galactus' Power Cosmic, to the point that Galactus reverted back to a mortal. However, he used a Cosmic Cube to do it and left it behind, which allowed Reed Richards "Reed Richards (Earth-616)") to pick it up and steal the Power Cosmic back, returning it to Galactus.
* **Beyonder "Beyonder (Earth-616)")'s powers:** Doom formerly had the powers of the cosmic being known as the Beyonder "Beyonder (Earth-616)"). He had vast psionic abilities, could easily change states of matter, and had a host of different powers. He was endowed with superhuman strength of such an extent that it was potentially incalculable. Using his ability to manipulate reality, he could, in effect, regenerate damage done to his body by simply willing it to be repaired. Other powers include teleportation, flight, the ability to choose his own physical resistances and attributes, as well as the ability to move others from one place to another via teleportation.
* **Life Force:** Doom had previously aided the Scarlet Witch "Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)") to obtain the power of the Life Force, which led to a sequence of events that ended up in her altering reality "House of M (Event)"). In the aftermath, Doom stole the Life Force from her and gained its reality warping abilities but lost control.
* **Beyonders' powers:** During the eight years of existence of Battleworld "Battleworld (Latverion)"), Doom possessed virtual omnipotence stolen from the race of Beyonders, which was absorbed and given to him by the Molecule Man "Owen Reece (Earth-616)"). He was able of holding together an entire planet composed of the remnants of destroyed realities "Battleworld (Latverion)") by thought alone, he could rearrange reality as he pleased, control space and time, teleport, resurrect the dead, reform from incineration and being shattered into pieces, overpower a host "Scott Summers (Earth-616)") of the Phoenix Force "Phoenix Force (Earth-616)"), and even defeat a wielder "T'Challa (Earth-616)") of the Infinity Gauntlet.
* **Phoenix Force:** During the Phoenix Force "Phoenix Force (Earth-616)")'s tournament, Doctor Doom was empowered by a portion of its power. Doom gained superhuman strength, cosmic pyrokinesis, and the ability to discharge psionic blasts. Due to the Phoenix favoring Steve Rogers over him, he realized that it wasn't worthwhile to continue and forfeited, losing the Phoenix's powers.
* **Pandora's Box powers:** During his time outside of the Multiverse, Doom went to an Island from an Unnamed Reality "w:c:fortnite:Reality: Unknown (Helios)") of the Omniverse and seized the power of the dangerous Pandora's Box of this Reality. Although his powers and exact strength in this state are unknown, Doom killed many heroes and villains of Earth-616, including: Thanos "Thanos (Earth-616)"), Ultron "Ultron (Earth-616)"), Silver Surfer "Norrin Radd (Earth-616)"), Fantastic Four "Fantastic Four (Earth-616)"), Moon Knight "Marc Spector (Earth-616)"), Doctor Strange "Stephen Strange (Earth-616)") and Galactus "Galan (Earth-616)"). Thor "Thor Odinson (Earth-616)") and Iron Man "Anthony Stark (Earth-616)") were also defeated. Before his power was turned against him during the final battle, he showed a Nigh-Invulnerability against all attacks, including space-time attacks that were supposed to send him back to Earth-616. However, after a long fight with many casualties against the Fortnite and Earth 616 heroes coalition, Doom was significantly weakened, enough for Pandora's Box powers to be ripped from him before being forcefully being sent back to Earth-616.

### Abilities

 

*_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_60_0001.jpg) Doctor Doom with the Power Cosmic*

* **Super-Genius Intelligence:** Doctor Doom's most dangerous weapon is his intellect. He is one of the top mortal minds on the planet. He even cured Ben Grimm "Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)") of his Thing form. Doctor Doom's Time Platform is one of numerous inventions; others include devices that can imbue people with powers, and many types of robots. He often uses "Doombots", exact mechanical replicas of himself. They look like him, talk like him, and even act like him. Individually, Doombots have an advanced AI (artificial intelligence) so that each one believes itself to be the real Doom. As a safety measure, each Doombot has a dampener program that is triggered whenever the real Doom (or another Doombot) is nearby. These "body doubles" appear when Doom cannot be present or is unwilling to risk his own life, and are often responsible for Doom's seeming return from certain death. Another common type of robot used is the Servo-Guard, the police force of Latveria. Doom specializes in all levels of physics, robotics, cybernetics, genetics, materials science, weapons technology, biochemistry, and time travel. He also has natural talents for leadership, strategy, politics, and manipulation. He was taught under leading roboticist Dr. Cronos "Alexi Cronos (Earth-616)"). He has been shown as a prodigious electrical and mechanical engineer, admired by Tony Stark "Anthony Stark (Earth-616)"), an inspired theoretician with extensive knowledge of parallel universes and dimensions,[*citation needed*] and even a practiced neurosurgeon, having surgically separated Hulk from Bruce Banner "Bruce Banner (Earth-616)"). His knowledge extents to virtually any scientific field and his mind is said to work as fast as a sophisticated computer. Doom's knowledge of magic enhances his scientific brilliance; the time platform is a result of combining the two skills. Doom’s consciousness was vast and powerful enough to download a planet’s worth of data.
* **Master Martial Artist:** During his time in Tibet, Doom was presumably trained in martial arts by the monks. He is vastly skilled in many combat techniques, both armed and unarmed. He has been trained by the best sword masters on Earth and can achieve very powerful nerve strikes. His combat skills are so great that he managed to kill a lion with his bare hands, to be indistinguishable to Daredevil while in his suit, and to wield Captain America "Steven Rogers (Earth-616)")'s shield as skillfully as Steve Rogers himself. He was also able to defeat Black Panther in close combat even when his suit was depowered and incapacitate Taskmaster "Anthony Masters (Earth-616)") on pure hand to hand, without the aid of technology or magic.
* **Peak Human Conditioning:** Doom has trained his body to the level of the finest human athlete. He is well-built, fast and agile. He has also displayed great reflexes and equilibrium. Victor once claimed that he was training and building himself physically for years, so as to be ready to face the demonic beings called from Mephisto during their annual confrontation. His physical strength and durability match even those of Daredevil.
* **Indomitable Will:** Doom has phenomenal determination, fearlessness, and strength of will. Indeed, he has the strongest will on Earth. Hence, he was able to resist psychic attacks from Emma Frost "Emma Frost (Earth-616)") and the mind control of the Purple Man "Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)") using only his will, to reject the mystical armor that the Soulsword provides the wielder on sheer willpower alone and while he was tortured in Hell, he refused to let a single audible indication of pain exit his mouth. Doom's willpower could be considered even godly as, after having stolen the Beyonders' omnipotent abilities for himself, he was capable of creating an entire new planet from the remnants of incursion points between collapsing worlds, that new planet was Battleworld. He held this world together with his will.
* **Highly Influential Connections:** As Monarch of Latveria, Doctor Doom has access to technological and military hardware. He also has command of conventional military forces; see Doctor Doom's Generals_(Earth-616) "Doctor Doom's Generals (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)").
* **Charismatic leader**: Doom is able to attract people's positive attraction, especially on the citizens of Latveria, even when his plans are failing. He is also a skilled politician and strategist and has occasionally been the leader of numerous teams, including the Cabal and the Fantastic Four.
* **Diplomatic Immunity:** As the leader of a sovereign nation, Doctor Doom often visits the United States or the United Nations "United Nations (Earth-616)") for political reasons. He enjoys diplomatic immunity during these trips, and his embassy is considered foreign soil. He has even been escorted by Captain America "Steven Rogers (Earth-616)") himself. After renouncing his status as ruler of Latveria, it is likely he lost this status. After reconquering Latveria, it's likely he regained it.
* **Artist:** Doom has shown himself to be a talented artist. He painted a duplicate of the Mona Lisa while using Layla Miller "Layla Miller (Earth-616)") as his model.
* **Pianist:** Doom has shown himself to be a talented pianist. He has played various compositions of his own creation.
* **Master Swordsman:** Doom has been shown being proficient in sword combat, having been trained by the best teachers - until he overcame them all - and being able to out-duel Warlord Krang "Krang (Earth-616)") in swordsmanship.
* **Weapon systems and vehicles proficiency:** Victor is highly proficient in the use of weapons, mostly those of his own creation, such as battle suits, ray weapons and bombs, but he also utilizes rifles "Stasis Gun (Doctor Doom)"), guns and grenades with great aiming ability. He has also been shown as a capable driver of vehicles such as the Excavator "Excavator (Doctor Doom)") and the Gyroscopic Aircraft
* **Multilingual:** Besides English, he speaks all languages spoken in Latveria, those being Latverian, German, Hungarian, and Romany and possibly several others.
* **Master Chef:** Doom is an expert cook. He described his *potatoes dauphinoise* as "the stuff of legends".

### Weaknesses

* **Ego:** It has been shown in the past that Doom can be manipulated by pandering to his sense of superiority, especially over Reed Richards "Reed Richards (Earth-616)"). Spider-Man "Peter Parker (Earth-616)") was able to gain his assistance concerning unknown technology by saying Reed could not figure it out. This ego is also the main reason for his vendetta against Reed, as he cannot accept that Reed understood his equations better than he did.

Former Weaknesses* **Deal with Mephisto:** Doom made a deal with the demon Mephisto "Mephisto (Earth-616)"); he was allowed to summon and challenge Mephisto once a year and try to win back the soul of his deceased mother, but each time he fails the people of Latveria will grow to despise him more and more. He later "rescued" his mother's soul and she left Mephisto's afterlife to a better one.
* **Pandora's Box Will:** After absorbing the souls of Pandora's Box, which were the incarnation of the Box itself, the souls gradually gave Doom an insatiable hunger to destroy. In order to suppress this hunger and better control his new destructive powers, Doom decided to create Pandora's Armor, made from the Arcane Artifacts, fragments of the Box itself.
* **Pandora's Chosen:** Interfering with fate itself by taking the powers of Pandora's Box, Doom fatally became vulnerable to the existence of Pandora's Chosen: Hope, the very embodiment of Hope within the box and the one who was always destined to "close" Pandora's Box, through the eternal cycle of time and fate. 

Paraphernalia
-------------

### Equipment

* **Titanium Armor:** Dr. Doom's original armor is a nuclear-powered, computer-assisted battle suit. It was magically forged at a monastery in Tibet, but since then has been repaired by normal (technological) means.
	+ **Enhanced Strength:** The armor gives Dr. Doom the ability to lift (press) several tons. He has held his own against Spider-Man "Peter Parker (Earth-616)") and Hulk "Bruce Banner (Earth-616)") in hand to hand combat. The armor also grants him such strength he can pulverize a diamond with no effort.
	+ **Enhanced Durability:** The armor is fashioned of a high-strength titanium alloy enchanted with magic and has been shown durable enough to take a blast from the Infinity Gauntlet to point-black range, with little to no harm. The armor managed to withstand a massive explosion of energy at ground zero , from the Marquis of Death "Clyde Wyncham Jr. (Earth-807128)") - which destroyed the entire capital of Latvia and the rest of the country.
	+ **Video Communicator:** Built into the right wrist is a video communicator, which he can use to stay in contact with his bases from any point on Earth.
	+ **Electric Shock:** The outer surface of the armor can generate a massive electric shock on command.
	+ **Electrical Field:** Also known as **Electrical Force Field**, the **Electro-Magnetic Amplifier** and **Neural Disruptor**, this mechanism allows Doom to generate a point-blank electric shock causing enormous damage to anyone daring enough to touch Doom - for example, someone in melee with him. It also affects, to a lesser extent, nearby people not in direct contact with Doom's armor. Anyone affected is susceptible to falling unconscious. Doom used this device to kill his clone_(Earth-616) "Victor von Doom (Clone) (Earth-616)") and also to knock down Elvin Haliday "Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)") and even Colossus "Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)"), who had resisted previous attacks. It was however not enough to stun The Thing "Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)") in the latter's mutated, "spiky" state.
	+ **Magnetic Polarity Controllers:** Besides manipulating metal, this device allows Doom to redirect Magneto's power against him.
	+ **Teleportation device:** Doom's armor is able to teleport him across a short-range of distances
	+ **Link to Doom's Time-Platform:** An invention Doom can use to travel through time
	+ **Flight:** Dr. Doom's suits of armor are upgraded to give him the power of flight without the use of jet-packs.
	+ **Jet-Packs:** The typical suit of armor has twin jet-packs mounted at the waist, though other suits (or modifications of the original suit) contain a single jet-pack mounted on the back.
	+ **Concussive Blasts:** Concussive bolts of force can be fired from the gauntlets, fingertips, palms and faceplate of the armor, though the mask only generates force blasts when it is not being worn.
	+ **Force-Field:** The suit's best defense is the force-field generated by the armor, which has a maximum radius of eight feet (and so can encompass others); Doom cannot attack without lowering his force-field.
	+ **Infrared Vision:** Infrared scanners in the helmet allow the wearer to detect heat sources, permitting night vision and the ability to see invisible persons (unless they do not give off or can somehow mask their heat signature).
	+ **Recycling System:** The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and recycling systems for air, food, water, and energy, allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure underwater or in outer space.
	+ **Sensor Systems:** Optical scanners in the helmet allow the helmet's eyepieces to be used as high-powered telescopes, and parabolic ear amplifiers fitted inside the helmet allow Doom to detect extremely faint sounds and unusual frequencies within the audible range for humans.
	+ **Vacuum Resistance** Doom's armor allows him to survive in space, underwater or at toxic environments.
	+ **Solar Energy Absorption:** A thermo-energizer allows the armor to absorb and store solar and heat energy, and use it to power the armor's other systems; this system can only be used while the force-field is deactivated.
	+ **Thermal Units:** This device hidden on Doom's gloves allowed him to spray a cloud of yellow mist with special properties to nullify invisibility powers of a character in an area. Once this enemy was located, Doom could easily change to a different attack.
	+ **Personal Adapters:** Using this device Doom can absorb multiple forms of energy.
	+ **Special protection against other machines:** Doom's armor is impervious to some of his other devices, such as the Disintegrator. His suit was also unhackable by the Extremis
	+ **Splinters of the True Cross:** Doom has claimed that his armor contains splinters of the True Cross, along with other such defenses (presumably to protect him from undead enemies, i.e. Dracula "Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)")) Considering Doom's capabilities to time travel, there is possibility of this being true.
	+ **Optional Systems:** The following devices could be added to Doom's armor at his whim, but Doom himself only carried them if he felt he would need those:
		- Energy Fist
		- Fingertip Darts
		- Image Projector "Image Projector (Doctor Doom)")
		- Inhibitor Ray
		- Instant Hypnotism Impulser
		- Intensified Molecule Projector
		- Ionic Blade
		- Knuckle Rockets
		- Mini-Missile Launcher
		- Nerve Impulse Scrambler
		- Neuro-Space Field
		- Sleeping Gas
		- Refrigeration Unit
		- Sonic Drill
		- Stun-Shocker

As a genius-level inventor and monarch of a sovereign nation, Doom can attain many other pieces of equipment as needed.

* **Cloak of Levitation:** As the new Sorcerer Supreme, Doom got hold of Strange's Cloak that allowed him to levitate.
* **Eye of Agamotto "Eye of Agamotto (Knowledge)"):** As the new Sorcerer Supreme, Doom got hold of Strange's Eye of Agamotto.

Former Equipment* **Iron Man Armor:** A suit of armor seemingly stolen by Doom from one of Tony Stark "Anthony Stark (Earth-616)")'s labs, potentially the Iron Man Armor Model 51 retrofitted to suit Doom's style. This armor has been used by Doom in combination with his magical abilities, and it grants him the following abilities:
	+ **Flight**
	+ **Cloaking**
	+ **Repulsor Blasts:** A concussive blast of energy.
	+ **Enhanced Strength**
	+ **Enhanced Durability**
	+ **Magnetic Manipulation**

* Doctor Doom possesses two different Infinity Gauntlets from two alternate realities, but due to that, they don't work the same way in his home reality.
* **Silver Surfer's Surfboard**
* **Mystical Armor:** Doom used mystic armor obtained through a bargain with the Hazareth Three "Hazareth Three (Earth-616)"). The exact specifications of this armor are unknown and it was apparently lost when the Hazareth Three "Hazareth Three (Earth-616)") withdrew their support and empowerment of Doom.
* **Destroyer Armor Replica "Destroyer (Doom's Creation)"):** A replica of the enchanted Destroyer armor "Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)") of the Asgardians Doom created after experimenting on the Asgardians. Powered by the life force of the Asgardians Doom experimented on, the armor was physically manned by Doom himself and provided him with enough power to go toe-to-toe with Thor "Thor Odinson (Earth-616)"). However, Thor eventually managed to destroy the armor with Mjolnir.
* **Magnetic Grabber**
* **Sleeping Gas Pistol**
* **Sub-Miniature Transistor-Powered Atomic Blast Gun**
* **Reducing Ray**
* **Idento-Disc** - These tissue-thin plastic discs allow Doctor Doom to track whatever they are attached to.
* **Lighter-than-Air Robots**
* **Holographic Image Projector** - Doctor Doom developed device that allows him to project holographic images of himself, complete with sound.
* Ultra-Heat Beam Pistol

* **Ultra Doom Armor:** A prototype suit of armor created by Doom, it's an enhanced version of his Titanium Armor crafted to withstand the power of Pandora's Box. However, the armor exploded after Doom absorbed the power of Pandora's Box, unable to withstand the power of the box.
	+ **Flight**
	+ **Repulsor Blasts:** A concussive blast of energy.
	+ **Enhanced Strength**
	+ **Enhanced Durability**

* **Pandora's Armor:** Armor forged at Castle Doom's Arcane Forge from fragments of Pandora's Box itelf, in order to have absolute control over his new powers. During Absolute Doom's final battle, the armor was significantly damaged and the mask was lost. However, it was not completely destroyed.
	+ **Flight**
	+ **Repulsor Blasts:** A concussive blast of energy.
	+ **Enhanced Strength**
	+ **Enhanced Durability**

### Weapons

Doom is sometimes shown carrying a sword in his belt.

Former Weapons* Doom often carried a "broomhandle" Mauser pistol, which he used to dispatch targets "unworthy" of his other means of attack.
* The Tactigon

### Transportation

* **Time Platform**

Former Transportation* Flying Fortress "Flying Fortress (Doctor Doom)")
* Aerosub
* Silver Surfer's surfboard.

Notes
-----

* In Latveria, Doom has his own holiday - Doom's Day, which is an enormous celebration.
* One of Doctor Doom's traits that often makes him stand out is his tendency to refer to himself in third person.
* Because of his status as ruler of Latveria, Doom typically has diplomatic immunity. This is perhaps his greatest asset, as any attempt to kill him would be a breach of international law - It has been used to prevent his death at the hands of the Fantastic Four "Fantastic Four (Earth-616)"), and resulted in Captain America "Steven Rogers (Earth-616)") acting as Doom's escort/bodyguard whilst he was making a diplomatic visit to America.
* Doom has learned magic from several powerful individuals, including Doctor Strange "Stephen Strange (Earth-616)") and Morgan Le Fay "Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)"). Doom has also taken apprentices of his own, such as Layla Miller "Layla Miller (Earth-616)").
* A limited series titled *Victor von Doom* was written by Nick Spencer with artist Becky Cloonan before being cancelled.

Trivia
------

* In one retcon, the scar that Doom originally received from the explosion of his arcane device was, while large, not horribly disfiguring. In his eagerness to assume his masked persona, he donned the faceplate of his first suit of armor while the metal was still smoking from the forge. The burns he suffered from this act were thought to have made him truly hideous. However, this was later itself retconned in the series Books of Doom.
* The original story of his scar was that the explosion of his demonic portal actually did cause a hideous disfiguring scar, and to suit his own hubris, he donned the infamous mask.
* After the Secret Wars "Secret Wars (1984 Event)"), the Beyonder "Beyonder (Earth-616)") appeared in Fantastic Four #288, where he explained that he had pulled Doom from a different time. He then rectified the situation by reordering Doom's appearances to fit the time-stream.
* Doom is allegedly a user of the FaceSpace social network, and friend to Nuwa "Nuwa (Earth-616)").
* Doctor Doom made a cameo appearance in the pages of DC's *JLA* #1. In the scene, Doom and Wolverine "James Howlett (Earth-616)") are executed by a super villain team known as the Hyperclan. The scene was written by Grant Morrison.
* In Captain Britain and MI13 #10, Doom states he has studied under one of Dracula "Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)")'s greatest enemies, suggesting that Doom has traveled back in time to study under Abraham van Helsing "Abraham van Helsing (Earth-616)"). He has also shown that he did not recognize Dracula's title of Count.
* Doom killed his first person at the age of sixteen, however it was in self-defense.
* Doom states that his self-awareness began when he was within his mother "Cynthia von Doom (Earth-616)")'s womb. Doom theorized that his mother's contact with demons is what made this possible, further stating that their "... *touch opened* [his] *mind too clearly and too early*".
* Benjamin Grimm "Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)") may have been responsible for the accident that disfigured Doom, saying that he had tampered with Doom's machine some time before the accident.
* Doom owns three **Renoirs**, having previously possessed four, but ordered one to be destroyed merely because it displeased him.

 

*_from_Marvel_Team-Up_Vol_1_33_001.jpg) Stamp Vol 1 84 "A" Series Marvel Value Stamps*

* Latveria has its own version of The Beatles' song *All You Need Is Love*, which replaces "love" for "Doom."
* Even though Doom was expelled from college before finishing his only known higher studies, he claims to possess multiple doctorates. Also, he began calling himself "Doctor Doom" before completing any higher education, as he took on the name immediately after hearing "***Doctor*** Reed Richards" on the news while still in the Himalayas.
* Doom has splinters of the True Cross which was said to be the Cross where Jesus Christ "Jesus of Nazareth (Earth-616)") was crucified. Doom holds these stakes in his armor in case he comes across Dracula.
* Doom has a shrine wall to Ziggy Pig "Ziggy Pig (Earth-616)") and Silly Seal "Silly Seal (Earth-616)").
* Victor appears to see some of himself in Jesus, since he considers himself a savior, and has quoted him during a confrontation with Mephisto.
* Doom believes that mutants "Mutants (Homo superior)") are not the next step in humanity's evolution, but instead serve to force the humans to evolve.
* When Doom took over Strange Academy "Strange Academy (Earth-616)"), he installed an "Anti-Reed Society."
